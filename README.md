# DeepSeek in Colab

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **DeepSeek Coder** models in **Google Colab**. DeepSeek Coder is a series of advanced language models trained on extensive code and natural language datasets. These models can perform **code completion, code infilling, and support multiple programming languages**, making them useful for developers and AI researchers.

## Features

- **Code Completion**: Predicts the next lines of code based on the given context.
- **Code Infilling**: Fills in missing sections within existing code structures.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with multiple programming languages, including **Python, JavaScript, Java, and more**.
- **Transformer-based Model**: Uses DeepSeek's pre-trained models for efficient code understanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have a Google account and access to **Google Colab**.

### Installation

The required dependencies are installed within the Colab notebook itself. However, if you are running the model locally, install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
